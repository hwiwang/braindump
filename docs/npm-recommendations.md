# npm package recommendations

These are recommendations for everyday use npm packages. This is mainly thought as a reminder tomyself, but it might be helpful for others as well. :smile:

I evaluated most of the packages that solved a particular problem (if there were more than one) based on performance, package size, tests and code quality.
